        /* This is an example of an Endless Loop.
            This happens when we create a Loop where the condition is always true.
            This will overload the DOM and the computer's memory will cause 
            performance problems. The Loop will never end unless we close the browser.
            The browser will most likely freeze up and we will have to force quit.
